          Hi, my name is Angelo Mendoza I am the owner and developer of Isabela
          Web Designs. I am currently in college studying Information
          Technology. Being the son of a single mother along with a little
          sister, I wanted to help out a little. So for the past two years, I
          have been studying in school and teaching myself how to create
          websites for small businesses and charge them the right way.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of small businesses have trouble spending thousands of dollars
          in one go to have their own website. One can only imagine the
          frustration these businesses go through which is why I adopted the $0
          down, $150 a month model. This removes the pain in our wallets and
          provides the client with a number of useful features that they might
          not get from other freelancers.
